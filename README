vDeploy
----------
vDeploy is a Python Package that contains utilities  to automatically
and rapidly deploy VM images from "templates" that are stored on an
object file store.  The VM template is an abstraction that has
properties such that the type of VM to deploy is unlinked from the
hypervisor that it is being deployed to.  For example, you may have a
template of an OpenBSD Kerberous KDC host that you would like to
commonly deploy to a tenant network. These tenant networks  could be
running on vSphere, XenServer, KVM, or Hyper-V hypervisors.  The
template object will be configurable as far as memory size, number of
CPUs, number of NICs, VM name, root passwords, etc. In order to
facilitate the deployment, the VM object may include different system
disk images depending on what the destination hypervisor will be. There
might even be  work-flow rules to constitute an appropriate disk image
from an initial ISO image.  The important point  here is that the
bits  that makes up the target deployment are un linked and some what
independent of the properties that describe the deployable instance.
This should allow one to use the same template object from store
to deploy on any Hypervisor that the tools currently have access to.
Obviously this could have  implications for OpenStack environments.
